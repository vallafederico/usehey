# UseHey()

_Sounds like a hook but it's not. Hey was taken._

**Multipurpose, bare bones front end state management and event emitter.**

Init with `useHey()`
Set state with `hey.something = 123`
Watch changes with `hey.on("something", () => conosle.log(hey.something))`

It'll be available globally, in all of your files without importing (all hail the window object).
